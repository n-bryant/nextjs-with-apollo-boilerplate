## Tech

This boilerplate app is an extension off of one of NextJS' own templates. This boilerplate adds additional configuration including some wrapper components for Page and Meta. The boilerplate also implements a configuration of nprogress in the form of the NextNProgress component, allowing for a loading state between route changes.
